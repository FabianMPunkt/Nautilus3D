# Nautilus3D

![Header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D-Files/main/05_Snake_Oil/Finals/_Header.jpg)

Nautilus3D is a Default 3D Resource-pack, mainly focused on 3D-Models with a vanilla style.

We aim to provide a highly polished pack with an emphasis on decorative blocks, strong optimization, and various little fixes.

Feel free to leave bug-reports & feature suggestions our [GitHub issue-page](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D/issues/new/choose "GitHub issue-page")!

## Compatibility
The current version officially supports 1.21.6, but it should more or less work all the way back to 1.13.

We highly recommend using Fabric (+ Sodium & Iris) since it is the defacto standard nowadays. OptiFine & Forge should work aswell, but you might run into issues with OptiFine since it has become somewhat outdated in recent years.

Some features (like the Trident) require OptiFine to work as intended.
For Fabric you can use these alternatives:
 - [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) and [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) for custom entity-models
 - [CIT-Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) for custom item-textures
 - [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) for connected-textures.

We used to make separate editions of the pack for Minecraft 1.8 - 1.12 up until Nautilus3D V1.8
If you still play on Minecraft 1.8 - 1.12 you can find older Nautilus3D versions in the GitHub [Release Archive](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D-Files/tree/main/_ReleaseArchive) folder.

## Performance
The only thing really impacting the in-game performance are our fancy leaves and their variations. We tried our best to make them as fast as possible, while not compromising on their variety.
If you're on Fabric/Sodium, we recommend using the ["Cull Less Leaves"](https://modrinth.com/mod/cull-less-leaves) mod to get back a bit of performance. If you wish to disable the leaves, you can do so using [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/respackopts)!

## Shaders
I'ts been a high priority for us to make Nautilus3D play nice with the vast majority of shaders out there. That's also why we don't include any fancy flower / vegetation models, because that would look horrible combined with wind effects. (Also, it's really hard to make lol)

Additonally, due to Minecrafts dodgy ambient occlusion and complete lack of Anti-Aliasing, even basic shaders would make a great difference.
This is especially visible on bushy leaves.

Our recommendations:
- [Sildurs Basic / Enhanced Default](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/)
- [Builder's QOL](https://modrinth.com/shader/builders-qol-shaders)
- [Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)
- [Make-Up - Ultrafast](https://modrinth.com/shader/makeup-ultra-fast-shaders)
- [SEUS Renewed](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/)
- [Chocapic V8 / V9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/chocapic13-shaders)

Other shaders will work aswell ofcourse, these are just my personal favourites :P
