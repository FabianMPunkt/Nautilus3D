Nautilus3D is a Minecraft Resource-pack, mainly focused on 3D-Models with a vanilla style.

We aim to provide a highly polished pack with an emphasis on decorative blocks, strong optimization, and various little fixes.

For bug-reports & feature-requests please open an issue on our [GitHub issue-page](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D/issues/new/choose "GitHub issue-page")!

## Compatibility
We always focus on the newest Minecraft version, but the pack should more or less work all the way back to 1.13.

We used to make separate editions of the pack for Minecraft 1.8 - 1.12, but ultimately decided to stop updating them some time ago.
If you still play on Minecraft 1.8 - 1.12 you can find older Nautilus3D versions in the GitHub [Release Archive](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D/tree/main/Release%20Archive) folder.

All testing is done using the latest Vanilla snapshot, and the latest stable Fabric ( + Sodium & Iris). Optifine, and Forge should work just fine aswell.

Some special features (like the Trident) require OptiFine to work as intended.
For Fabric you can use these alternatives:
 - [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) and [ETF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) for custom entity-models
 - [CIT-Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn) for custom item-textures
 - [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity) for connected-textures.


## Performance
The only thing really impacting the in-game performance are our fancy leaves and their variations. We tried our best to make them as fast as possible, while not compromising on their variety.
If you're on Fabric/Sodium, we recommend using the ["Cull Less Leaves"](https://modrinth.com/mod/cull-less-leaves) mod to get back a bit of performance.

## Shaders
I'ts been a high priority for us to make Nautilus3D play nice with the vast majority of shaders out there. That's also why we don't include any fancy flower / vegetation models, because that would look horrible combined with wind effects. (Also, it's really hard to make lol)

Additonally, due to Minecrafts dodgy ambient occlusion and complete lack of Anti-Aliasing, even basic shaders would make a great difference.
This is especially visible on bushy leaves.

Our top picks are:
- [Sildurs Basic / Enhanced Default](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/)
- [Builder's QOL](https://modrinth.com/shader/builders-qol-shaders)
- [Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)
- [Make-Up - Ultrafast](https://modrinth.com/shader/makeup-ultra-fast-shaders)
- [SEUS Renewed](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/)
- [Chocapic V8 / V9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/chocapic13-shaders)
