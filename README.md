Nautilus3D is a Minecraft Resource-pack, mainly focused on 3D-Models with a vanilla style.

We aim to provide a highly polished pack with a focus on decorative blocks, strong optimization, and various little fixes.

This project is Open-Source and all files are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D)

For bug-reports & feature-requests please open an issue on our [GitHub issue-page](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D/issues/new/choose "GitHub issue-page")!

## Compatibility
We will always lay our focus on the newest version of Minecraft, but the pack should more or less work all the way back to 1.13, due to [the flattening update](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.13/Flattening).

Old Editions for Minecraft 1.8, and 1.12 will not recieve updates anymore. You can still find them in the [Release Arcive](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D/tree/main/Release%20Archive) folder.

All testing is done using the latest stable Vanilla release, and the latest available Fabric, Sodium & Iris. Optifine, and Forge should work just fine aswell.

Some features (like the Trident) will only work with OptiFine.
There are also Fabric mods that can provide OptiFine-parity, like [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features), [CIT-Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn), and [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity), but i couldn't get them working in 1.20 yet.

Important: Please always use the latest versions of Sodium / Forge / Fabric / OptiFine / etc.. or you might run into _very_ unexpected issues.

### Shaders
I'ts been a high priority for us to make Nautilus3D play nice with most shaders that are out there. That's also why we didn't include any fancy flower / vegetation models, because that would look horrible combined with wind effects. (Also, it's really hard to make lol)

Additonally, due to Minecrafts dodgy ambient occlusion and complete lack of Anti-Aliasing, even basic shaders would make a great difference.
This is especially visible on bushy leaves.

Our top picks are:
- [Sildurs Basic / Enhanced Default](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/)
- [Builder's QOL](https://modrinth.com/shader/builders-qol-shaders)
- [Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)
- [Make-Up - Ultrafast](https://modrinth.com/shader/makeup-ultra-fast-shaders)
- [SEUS Renewed](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/)
- [Chocapic V8 / V9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/chocapic13-shaders)
