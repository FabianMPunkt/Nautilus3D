## Compatibility
There's three existing versions:

- Nautulus3D 1.8
- Nautulus3D 1.9 - 1.12
- Nautulus3D 1.13 +

The main focus is of course always laid on the newest version of the game. Most of the testing is done on the latest stable OptiFine release.

The Pack works with Forge, Fabric and Sodium. Although some features only work with OptiFine. (see list below)
Important: Please always use the latest versions of Sodium / Forge / Fabric / OptiFine / etc.. or you might run into _very_ unexpected issues.

Versions below 1.12 include the new 1.14 textures.
