# Nautilus3D


Nautilus3D is a Minecraft Resource-pack, mainly focused on 3D-Models with a vanilla style.

We aim to provide a highly polished pack with a focus on decorative blocks, and strong optimization.

For bug-reports & feature-requests please open an issue on our [GitHub issue-page](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D/issues/new/choose "GitHub issue-page")!


## Noteworthy Features

- Randomness
  - Fully randomized bookshelves
  - Fully randomized chiselled bookshelves
  - Fully randomized ores
  - Fully randomized crops
  - Semi random crafting table

- Animated 3D Stonecutter
- Epic Trident handmodel (requires OptiFine)
- Flawless bushy leaves
- Fully featured doors & trapdoors
- Flawless rails
- Detailed brewing stand


## Compatibility
There's three existing editions:

- Nautulus3D 1.8
- Nautulus3D 1.9 - 1.12
- Nautulus3D 1.13 +

Nautilus3D V1.8 will be the last version available for 1.12 and older. Moving forward, we will ony support newer versions of the game. All old releases will still be in the [Release Arcive](https://github.com/FabianMPunkt/Nautilus3D/tree/main/Release%20Archive) folder.

The main focus is always laid on the newest version of the game, but the pack should work all the way back to 1.13, due to [the flattening update](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.13/Flattening).

All testing is done using the latest stable OptiFine release, and the latest available Fabric & Sodium.

Some features (like the Trident) will only work with OptiFine.
There are also Fabric mods that can provide OptiFine-parity, like [EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features), [CIT-Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn), and [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity), but i couldn't get them working in 1.20 yet.

Important: Please always use the latest versions of Sodium / Forge / Fabric / OptiFine / etc.. or you might run into _very_ unexpected issues.

### Shaders
I'ts been a high priority for us to make Nautilus3D play nice with most shaders that are out there. That's also why we didn't include any fany flower / vegetation models, because that would look horrible combined with wind effects. (Also, it's really hard to make lol)

Additonally, due to Minecrafts dodgy ambient occlusion and complete lack of Anti-Aliasing, even basic shaders would make a great difference.
This is especially visible on bushy leaves.

Our top picks are:
- [Sildurs Basic / Enhanced Default](https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/downloads/)
- [Complementary Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)
- [Make-Up - Ultrafast](https://modrinth.com/shader/makeup-ultra-fast-shaders)
- [SEUS Renewed](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/)
- [Chocapic V8 / V9](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/chocapic13-shaders)
